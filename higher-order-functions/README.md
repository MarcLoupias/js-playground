In javascript, **functions are values** like strings or numbers.

They can be assigned to variables or passed to others functions as argument.

Theses functions are named **higher order functions**.

For what purpose ?

Composition.

One of the most basic example is the use of a `filter` higher order function.

`filter` will takes as parameter a function defining the filter criteria.
