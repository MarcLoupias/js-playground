# node as bash

a simple example to show that it is possible to use javascript with node to write `bash` like scripts.

This example is writing a file on the filesystem.

**How to**

- give execution permission to your `js` file.
- add `#!/usr/bin/env` node to the top of the `js` file.
- run it like a normal script with a simple `node-as-bash/app.js`.

It is just a shortcut to `node node-as-bash/app.js`.
