[Currying - Part 6 of Functional Programming in JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZLP4qOwY8I&t=324s&index=6&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84)

Currying is when a function doesn't takes all of his arguments upfront.

Instead it takes the first argument and then return a function. 

The second function takes the second argument and return a function ... etc ...

Then the function at the end of the chain will return the final output value.
